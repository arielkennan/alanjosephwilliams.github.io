<h2>Concept Development</h2>

<p class="lead">Shape your best ideas into more complete concepts including what you could prototype to test out the concept.</p>

<h3>Process</h3>
<p>Shape your best ideas into more complete concepts. Concept development can take on many forms including longer form writing or a short presentation deck. Make the case for the problem youâ€™re trying to solve, lay out the solution, tell how your user would use it and benefit from it, and develop different approaches to how you could prototype to test out the concept.</p>

<h3>Potential Deliverables</h3>
