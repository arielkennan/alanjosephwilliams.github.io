<h2>User Research</h2>

<p class="lead">User research helps you channel the needs, desires, and motivations of the people who use what you create.</p>

<p>Start with your user. Who’s going to be using what you want to create? Is it a general government service used by everyone? Does it focus on a specific demographic? Is it an internal resource? You’ll want to define who your users are and then go talk to them. To fully empathize with the user, you need to understand their needs, desires, and motivations. Try to find out what is the biggest pain point for them in interacting with government in addition to what they have had a good experience with. You can do research in a variety of different ways including one-on-one interviews, focus groups, surveys, etc. Pick what’s right for your project, but it’s important you don’t skip this step.</p>
