<h2>Test</h2>

<p class="lead">Take your prototype out into the world and test it with real users.</p>

<p>Think of the process of designing, prototyping, and testing as a cyclical process of continuous learning. You have to learn by doing. Create the minimal part of the vision, and then test your design. It’s ok not to get it right the first time. Design, prototype, test. Then repeat. It’s a cyclical process of continuous learning. But more than anything it’s about building trust through delivery, and building trust through listening.</p>
