<h2>Experience Maps</h2>

<p class="lead">Chart the experience moments including steps in a process and the emotions and feelings, such as delight or satisfaction, as well as the decisions that a user must make.</p>

<h3>Process</h3>

<p>Your goal is to map the experience that a user will have while using what you’re creating, whether it’s a new online service or a process for an in person interaction. What are the steps? What decisions do they make? What emotions does it elicit? You may have different experience maps for different users.

It can take really any form you want, from the casual sketch to a more detailed diagram, if the project requires. Many designers like to start with sticky notes as they are easy to rearrange. Start by writing one key action per sticky note. Do the actions feel like they’re in the correct order? If a user makes a decision, how does the experience branch?

Review your experience map with other team members and iterate together. You’ll soon have a tool that will inform the rest of your design.</p>
