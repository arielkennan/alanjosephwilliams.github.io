	<p>Governments are embracing design — not as a trend, but as a way to transform how we deliver services and information to the public. Public servants are using design principles to craft effective digital servants, and designers are joining the ranks of government.</p>

	<p>Designing Government is an introduction to design for public servants, and a set of tactical ways to include design in your work. In advance of the inaugural <a href="http://civicdesigncamp.org/">Civic Design Camp</a>, we are prototyping a playbook for bringing to design to bear in the public sector. We’re collecting case studies that illustrate the impact design can have on government–along with the concrete details about how determined public servants we’re able to achieve positive outcomes.</p>
